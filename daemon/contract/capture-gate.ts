/**
 * Audio capture gate (S-4, docs/plans/nova-one-product-pivot.md §4.5).
 *
 * The core privacy contract: audio frames never reach Deepgram (and therefore
 * never reach the orchestrator, Obsidian, or memory) unless EITHER
 *   (a) the user opened a capture window via a button press within the last
 *       NOVA_CAPTURE_WINDOW_MS (button-press gating), OR
 *   (b) the device has hands-free mode turned on AND the operator has not
 *       forbidden hands-free at the server level (NOVA_HANDS_FREE_ALLOWED).
 *
 * Hands-free mode *admits* frames into the STT pipeline; owner-voice filtering
 * then drops non-owner utterances at the STT-output layer (see stt.ts). That
 * split is intentional: Deepgram diarisation is required to know who is
 * speaking, so we can't gate at the frame level for hands-free.
 *
 * This module is deliberately pure — it takes a snapshot and returns a
 * decision. No fs, no db, no env. The env-level hands-free allow bit is
 * passed in by the caller so tests don't need to set env vars.
